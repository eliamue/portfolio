    "description": "Born and raised in the Twin Cities, my hobbies keep me very busy when I'm not coding. I love to learn, and aside from continuing to hone my dev skills, I've been learning French, Korean, dance, candle-making, and D&D. I love games of all sorts: whetehr it's board, card, video, or roleplaying, I'm always down to game! I can't get enough of cosplay, K-Pop, art, camping, animals, karaoke, and trivia, and dearly wish I was a better gardener. Disability advocacy is one of my biggest passions, and I dream of creating things that combine this with my creativity, coding skills, and love of gaming.",
