    "description": "Born and raised in the Twin Cities, my hobbies keep me very busy when I'm not coding. I love to learn, and aside from continuing to hone my dev skills, I've been learning French, Korean, dance, candle-making, and D&D. I love games of all sorts: board, card, video, or roleplaying, I'm always down to game! Disability advocacy is one of my biggest passions, and I dream of creating things that combine this with my creativity, coding skills, and love of gaming.",

The users input a command to be given a randomly generated prompt from a selection of story types, and can tag another user for RoundRobin to alert to add a sentence. Other commands include 'read', which returns the full story with every added sentence in order, 'erase', which ends the game by erasing the story and allowing users to start with a new story prompt, and 'speak', which uses Discord's text-to-speech capabilities to read the story progress aloud.",
