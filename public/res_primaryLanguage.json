    "description": "I'm Elise Muellerleile. My goal is to combine my background experience with my ever-developing tech skills in software development to improve the inclusivity, beauty, and accessibility of technology. I am passionate about building dynamic apps and web experiences that accommodate the needs of marginalized communities that have long been excluded from innovative technology. While my background is specialized in the mental health field, I use the diverse skills from my unique experiences to emphasize creativity, empathy, and inclusiveness in my work. Whether itâ€™s working front-end or back-end, solo or in a team, as a leader or supporter, I've got energy and determination to share! I am fiercely dedicated to managing goals end-to-end, and am eager to find a diverse team to work with to develop striking, accessible user experiences.",

The vaporwave-themed Vibn was developed by a remote team of three during a two-week sprint using React, Express, postgreSQL, Node.js, CSS, HTML, and Spotify Authorization. A demo version of Vibn has been added so that non-authorized users can explore the app, as Spotify's authorization requires that users have their email addresses manually added to a max list of 20 in order to access their API.",
