    "description": "I'm Elise Muellerleile. My goal is to combine my background experience with my ever-developing tech skills in software development to improve the inclusivity, beauty, and accessibility of technology. I am passionate about building dynamic apps and web experiences that accommodate the needs of marginalized communities that have long been excluded from innovative technology. Experienced, driven learner and creator. While my background is specialized in the mental health field, I use the diverse skills from my unique experiences to emphasize creativity, empathy, and inclusiveness in my work. Whether it’s working front-end or back-end, alone or in a team, as a leader or supporter, I've got energy and determination to share! I am fiercely dedicated to managing goals end-to-end, and am eager to find a diverse team to work with to develop striking, accessible user experiences.",
